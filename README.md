# Job top sheet generator
This is a project that I created to track a bunch of orders that I combine to make a print job with Roland-Print-Automation in my workflow.

I am using powershell as my main interface.

this is run by using node for powershell and calling app.js with a bunch of directly assigned variables and also a json file that contains each order's information.
